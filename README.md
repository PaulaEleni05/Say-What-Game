Say What?! is a browser-based guessing game that explores the limitations of AI translation systems when dealing with slang and idioms. While AI tools can translate literal text effectively, they often struggle with non-literal expressions that rely on cultural and regional context. This game highlights those challenges in a fun and interactive way

In each round, the player is shown a literal English translation of a slang phrase or idiom taken from another language. The translation is intentionally confusing or misleading. The player must guess the actual meaning of the phrase based only on the literal translation. For extra points, the player can also try to guess the language the phrase comes from for extra point.

Players have a limited number of attempts and can request hints if needed. At the end of each round, the game reveals the original phrase, its correct meaning, and its language. This allows players to directly compare the literal translation with the real meaning and see where AI translation falls short.

Say What?! is designed to be both entertaining and educational. It encourages players to think critically about AI-generated translations and raises awareness of the limitations of relying on AI for understanding language, especially when cultural context is involved.
